\title{Constructive options for atomic types}
\usage{
opts_atomic(..., trim = NULL, fill = c("default", "rlang", "+", "...", "none"))
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Should not be used. Forces passing arguments by name.}

\item{trim}{\code{NULL} or integerish. Maximum of elements showed before it's trimmed.
Note that it will necessarily produce code that doesn't reproduce the input.
This code will parse without failure but its evaluation might fail.}

\item{fill}{String. Method to use to represent the trimmed elements.}
}
\value{
An object of class <constructive_options/constructive_options_atomic>
}
\description{
These options will be used on atomic types ("logical", "integer", "numeric", "complex", "character" and "raw")
}
\details{
If \code{trim} is provided, depending on \code{fill} we will present trimmed elements as followed:
\itemize{
\item \code{"default"} : Use default atomic constructors, so for instance \code{c("a", "b", "c")} might become \code{c("a", character(2))}.
\item \code{"rlang"} : Use rlang atomic constructors, so for instance \code{c("a", "b", "c")} might become \code{c("a", rlang::new_character(2))},
these \code{rlang} constructors create vectors of \code{NAs}, so it's different from the default option.
\item \code{"+"}: Use unary \code{+}, so for instance \code{c("a", "b", "c")} might become \code{c("a", +2)}.
\item \code{"..."}: Use \code{...}, so for instance \code{c("a", "b", "c")} might become \code{c("a", ...)}
\item \code{"none"}: Don't represent trimmed elements.
}

Depending on the case some or all of the choices above might generate code that
cannot be executed. The 2 former options above are the most likely to suceed
and produce an output of the same type and dimensions recursively. This would
at least be the case for data frame.

construct(iris, opts_atomic(trim = 2)) # fill = "default"
construct(iris, opts_atomic(trim = 2, fill = "rlang"))
construct(iris, opts_atomic(trim = 2, fill = "+"))
construct(iris, opts_atomic(trim = 2, fill = "..."))
construct(iris, opts_atomic(trim = 2, fill = "none"))
