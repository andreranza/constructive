\usage{
opts_quosure(
  constructor = c("new_quosure", "next", "language"),
  ...,
  origin = "1970-01-01"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{constructor}{String. Name of the function used to construct the environment, see Details section.}

\item{...}{Should not be used. Forces passing arguments by name.}

\item{origin}{Origin to be used, ignored when irrelevant.}
}
\value{
An object of class <constructive_options/constructive_options_factor>
}
\description{
These options will be used on objects of class 'quosure'.
}
\details{
Depending on \code{constructor}, we construct the environment as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{"new_quosure"} (default): Build the object using a \code{new_quosure()} call on a
character vector.
\item \code{"next"} : Use the constructor for the next supported class. Call \code{.class2()}
on the object to see in which order the methods will be tried.
\item \code{"language"} : We define as an language object and repair attributes.
}
}
