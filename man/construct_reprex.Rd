\usage{
construct_reprex(n = 0, include_call = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of steps to go up on the call stack}

\item{include_call}{Whether to include the call to the function that created the next
frame, ignored for \code{n == 0}}

\item{...}{Forwarded to \code{construct_multi()}}

\description{
\code{construct_reprex()} creates a reprex that constructs the local environment,
or a caller environment \code{n} steps above. If \code{n > 0} the function call
is included by default.
}
\details{
A useful trick is to use \code{construct_reprex()} with \code{options(error = recover)}
to be able to reproduce an error.
