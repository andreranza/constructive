# constructive 

{constructive} prints code that can be used to recreate R objects. In a sense it
is similar to `base::dput()` but {constructive} strives to use "natural" constructors
(`factor` for factors, `as.Date()` for dates, `data.frame()` for data frames etc),
in order to get output readable by humans.

Some use cases are: 

* Snapshot tests
* Exploring objects (alternative to `dput()` or `str()`)
* Creating reproducible examples from existing data
* Comparing two objects (using `construct_diff()`)

## Installation

Install with:

```
remotes::install_github("cynkra/constructive")
```

## Examples

A few examples compared to their `dput()` output.

```{r, error = TRUE}
library(constructive)

construct(head(iris, 2))
dput(head(iris, 2))

construct(.leap.seconds)
dput(.leap.seconds)

library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
grouped_band_members <- group_by(band_members, band)
dput(grouped_band_members)
construct(grouped_band_members)
```

We can provide to the `data`argument a list, environment, or package where to look
for data so we don't print more than necessary, for example improving the previous example:

```{r}
construct(grouped_band_members, data = "dplyr")
```

We can also trim the output and display only `max_atomic` elements at most from a vector,
or `max_list` elements from a list. Notice the last element of trimmed objects,
prefixed by `+`, showing how many items were not printed.

```{r}
construct(dplyr::starwars, max_atomic = 2, max_list = 1)
```
If we set those to `0` we build a prototype :

```{r}
construct(dplyr::starwars, max_atomic = 0, max_list = 0)
```
Some other options :

```{r}
construct(band_members, tribble = TRUE)
construct(as.data.frame(band_members), read.table = TRUE)
```
## Limitations

Environments are not always possible to reproduce but we support some common cases.
Due to this several objects such as formulas, srcrefs, R6 objects, ggplot objects
etc might not be reproducible exactly. If an approximation is enough one might
set `check = FALSE` (don't fail if object cannot be reproduced), `ignore_srcref = TRUE` (don't fail if srcrefs are different), `env_as_list = FALSE` (don't attempt to recreate fancy environments, simply use `new.env()` instead).

## construct_diff

`construct_diff()` highlights the differences in the code used to produce 2 objects.

Let's try it on ggplot objects, these objects are very complex and {constructive}
cannot reproduce them exactly (because environments can't be reproduced reliably)
but we can get close enough to see how adding a geom changes the structure of the object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
construct_diff(
  ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)),
  ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point(),
  max_atomic = 3, 
  env_as_list = FALSE, #  -> use `new.env()` to produce env objects
)
```
