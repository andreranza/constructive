\usage{
.cstr_new_class(
  class = c("CLASS", "PARENT_CLASS"),
  constructor = "CONSTRUCTOR",
  commented = FALSE
)

.cstr_new_constructor(
  class = "CLASS",
  constructor = "CONSTRUCTOR",
  commented = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{class}{Class to support, for \code{.cstr_new_class()} provide the full
\code{class()} vector, for \code{.cstr_new_constructor()} the first element is enough.}

\item{constructor}{Name of the constructor, usually the name of the function
you can to use to build the object. If not you might need to adjust the
script.}

\item{commented}{Boolean. Whether to include comments in the template.}
}
\value{
Both function return \code{NULL} invisibly and are called for side effects
}
\description{
\code{.cstr_new_class()} and \code{.cstr_new_constructor()} open new unsaved scripts,
optionally commented, that can be used as templates to define new constructors.
If the class is already supported and you want to implement a new constructor,
use \code{.cstr_new_constructor()}, otherwise use \code{.cstr_new_class()}.

We recommend working from these templates and examples in this package or
}
\details{
We suggest the following workflow :
\itemize{
\item Call these functions, with \code{commented = TRUE} for more guidance
\item Save the scripts unchanged in your package
\item \code{devtools::document()}: this will register the S3 methods
\item Try \code{construct()} on your new object, it should print a call to your chosen
constructor
\item Tweak the code, in particular the definition of \code{args}
}
