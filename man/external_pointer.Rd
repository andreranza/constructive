\title{Build a pointer from a memory address}
\usage{
external_pointer(address)
}
\arguments{
\item{address}{Memory address}
}
\description{
Base R doesn't provide utilities to build or manipulate external pointers
(objects of type "externalptr"), so we provide our own. Be warned that
objects defined with \code{external_pointer()} are not stable across sessions,
however this is the best we can
}
